This week I didn't get anything done in regard to actually writing code. However, I spent a great deal of time speaking with my music teacher regarding the technical aspects of serialism and how best to reproduce them on a computer. In addition to this background work, I started taking tutorials on the use of processing, the language I intend to use for my project.
