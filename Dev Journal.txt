This week I didn't get anything done in regard to actually writing code. However, I spent a great deal of time speaking with my music teacher regarding the technical aspects of serialism and how best to reproduce them on a computer. In addition to this background work, I started taking tutorials on the use of processing, the language I intend to use for my project. I have prepared a basic outline of the way the gui will appear and have begun to practice the matrices that define serialism so I won't mess them up when I actually move to code them in. I have also spent a small amount of time thinking of the best way to represent musical notes (and potentially tones) that would give a much more aesthetically interesting spin to my project. Finally, I have decided to include multiple serialist "styles" to give the user a more interesting and useful program.
